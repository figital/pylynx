Pylynx is a web browser written in Python.
It is based primarily around the [Urwid](http://excess.org/urwid/) library and the xml.dom module of the standard library. [BeautifulSoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) is also used for sanitizing broken code.

It is being written by a single developer already juggling school and a job. As such, it is still under heavy development and a noteworthy release is not available.
Expect development to speed up over the summer of 2010.
