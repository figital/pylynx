<h1>Hello world!</h1>
<hr/>
<p>This is just a short page to test out pylynx. If all goes well, this should be rendered as one pile with three block nodes beneath it. The header and paragraph should consist of piles with one Text node, and the horizontal rule should be rendered with the Divider widget. Did it work?</p>
